There's not a lot of pieces to a desktop computer. Here's what I have, bought just after the pandemic started and it became clear I was going to be working from home for a substantial amount of time.

I had a few goals and requirements for this build:

1. Low cost
2. Lots of CPU
3. 64GB of memory
4. No need for gaming

I knew that I would run several VMs on the workstation, mostly to split out different things I need to do, for example access work related systems via a VPN in a windows based virtual machine, have a VM for doing demos, ect ect.

The cost of this build was, pre-tax, $1300 CDN! With Ontario tax and the $50 build fee it came out to just over $1500.

I bought the parts at [Memory Express](https://www.memoryexpress.com/) and had them build the system for an extra $50. They were great to work with.

| Component | Item | Cost  |

| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Processor  | $259.99   |
| Case | Corsair Carbide Series 100R Mid-Tower Case, Silent Edition, Black | $89.99 |
| Memory | Corsair Vengeance LPX 64GB DDR4 2666MHz CL16 Dual Channel Kit (4x 16GB), Black | $389.99 |

| Power Source | Corsair RMx Series RM550x 80+ Gold Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, 550W  | $144.99 |
| Motherboard | Asus TUF B450-PRO GAMING w/ DDR4-2666 | $169.99 |
| Video Card | Gigabyte GeForce GT 710 2GB GDDR5 Low-Profile PCI-E w/ HDMI, DVI | $79.99 |

*NOTE: This video card is pretty limited. But works great to power a HDMI monitor.*
